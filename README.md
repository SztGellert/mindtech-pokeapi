# mindtech-pokeapi

This is a full-stack application with both back-end and frontend service that allows a user to display pokemons and filter them. 
The backend implementation uses NodeJS with NestJS Framework, the frontend uses Angular/TypeScript with Ionic framework + FireBase live database for authentication.


The frontend is managed with Nodejs version 10 (LTS), the backend implementation was used with the latest node version by the reason of learning/development stage.

For this reason NVM (Node Version Manager) was used.

download & install https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm
for the frontend:
nvm install 10.24.1
nvm use 10.24.1
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
ionic serve (same as ng serve)

for the backend the latest version of node was used, run separately.
